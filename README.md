## Overview

This project is a Jekyll-based website for showcasing content. It includes configuration files, dependencies, and a content structure to facilitate easy building and serving of the site.

## Building and Serving the Site

To build and serve the Jekyll site, you can use Rake to automate the process. Follow these steps:

1. Install the required gems by running:
   ```
   bundle install
   ```

2. Use the following command to build and serve the site:
   ```
   rake serve
   ```

This command will execute the build process, clean any previous builds, and serve the site with live reloading and incremental builds.
