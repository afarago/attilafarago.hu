I have been engaged with STEM/STEAM education, incuding LEGO robotics for the past 10 years both in the coach and the judge roles in FIRST LEGO League and World Robot Olympiad as well.

I am enthusiastic about helping individuals and teams to grow to their best and also learn from many experts all over the world. For me, learning, networking, and helping develop others are worth much more than winning.
