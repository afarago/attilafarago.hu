# Miscellaneous Coding Projects

Here you'll find a collection of my miscellaneous coding projects, primarily built with TypeScript. These projects showcase a variety of tools, libraries, and experiments, reflecting my interest in modern web development, automation, and creative problem-solving. Each project highlights different aspects of TypeScript, from backend utilities to frontend applications.
