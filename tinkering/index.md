# Tinkering, Electronics and 3D-printing

![tinkering](/assets/tinkering.png){: .project-logo }

I love tinkering, soldering, 3d printing and electronics.

A microcontroller is a compact integrated circuit designed to govern a specific operation in an embedded system. A typical microcontroller includes a processor, memory and input/output (I/O) peripherals on a single chip.\
Some of my favorite MCUs include Arduino Uno, Espressif ESP8266 and Espressif ESP32.

My soldering skills were basic and are improving - apologies to all the professionals out in the world and at the same time and celebrate my improvements over time with me.
